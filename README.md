# Customer-Churn-Prediction

The Customer Churn Prediction System is a machine learning–powered web application designed to predict whether a customer is likely to discontinue a service. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment through a Flask-based web interface.

The system analyzes customer attributes such as tenure, monthly charges, total billing, internet service type, and contract details. A trained Random Forest classifier learns patterns from historical customer data and generates real-time churn predictions. The web interface allows users to input customer details and instantly receive a prediction in a clear and user-friendly format.

In addition to prediction, the project includes graphical analysis of churn trends, feature importance visualization, and input validation mechanisms to ensure reliable results. The goal of the system is to support data-driven decision making and help organizations proactively retain high-risk customers.
